<i>Make School CS 1.2: Music Playlist Assignment</i>

This project was created with Python 3.7.4.

This project uses OOP design to create an interactive Command Line song playlist with a linked list structure. The user runs the program in Command Line to see a menu of options: 1) View playlist, 2) Add a song to the playlist, 3) Remove a song from the playlist, 4) Search for a song in the playlist, and 5) Return the length of the playlist. Each `Song` object is a node, and the `Playlist` object is the linked list.
